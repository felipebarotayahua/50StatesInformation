**50 States**

# FinalProject
My final project where I display 50 states using API. 


Felipe Baro-Tayahua


My goal for this assignment was to properly use an API and implement everything that I have learn thusfar for the semester.

My final project is a website that shows all 50 states and their respective information. The landing page is the map of the united states and a search feature that I created that allows you to search for a state and a modal pops up displaying all the information over the state.
The quiz page was a simple page with the same color scheme but i integrated my knowledge of Javascript to create a responsive quiz that immediately told you whether something was right or wrong. 
The final page is a "Information" page where all the information for every single state is displayed if you wish to scroll through. 

Less: Less was used to keep the colors and fonts consistent. I felt that it made the most sense since everything is going to be the same to retain the consistency. I also added a couple NAV/NAVBAR changes that would work with both desktop and mobile. I also added a few Preprocessors nothing too indepth but it was something like this "*, *::before, *::after". A few others as well.

Hamburger menu was used and with the help of bootstrap I was able to make it responsive in no time. It provides a link to all html files and lets you navigate the web page. 

I was tasked to use 4 bootstrap features. I used a couple some of these features that I used are Form Control which was used for the search feature. Another feature was modals, they would appear as soon as you searched for something. Lastly the last two things that I would say is bootstrap would be the Hamburger menu and probably the layouts like containers and grid. 

As for accessibility I provided aria labels for example under the search feature, it reads out "Close", "Search for a state..", etc....

Overall, I believe I was able to provide a functional website with almost everything that was taught during the semester.
